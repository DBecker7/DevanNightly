This requires a lot more information than I have available, and will not be persued here.\n\n## Top half of the Technical\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n    library(dplyr)\n    library(ggplot2)\n})\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\nbo <- read.csv(\"GreatBritishBakeOff.csv\")\n\nbo <- bo |>\n    filter(Competed == 1, !is.na(Technical.Rank)) |>\n    group_by(Season, Week.Number) |>\n    mutate(\n        pos_perc = Technical.Rank / max(Technical.Rank)\n    ) |>\n    ungroup()\n\ntable(bo$Star.Baker, bo$pos_perc <= 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   \n    FALSE TRUE\n  0   386  283\n  1    24   74\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bo) +\n    aes(x = pos_perc <= 0.5, fill = factor(Star.Baker == 1)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\", colour = 1) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"In Top 50%?\",\n        y = \"Proportion\",\n        fill = \"Star baker?\"\n    ) +\n    coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYes, it does seem like being in the top 50% makes you more likely to win star baker, but not by a lot.\n\n## Splitting by Week\n\nPerhaps it's more important to do well in the technical in the early weeks?\n\nLooking at the rank in each week will help us see exactly what's going on. The following plot is a little different from the one before: It's just the raw counts, rather than percentages. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bo) +\n    aes(x = Technical.Rank, fill = factor(Star.Baker == 1)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"stack\", colour = 1) +\n    facet_wrap(~ Week.Number) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Rank in the Technical Challenge\",\n        y = \"Count\",\n        fill = \"Star Baker?\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can see that star bakers tend to have won the technical. In other words, the baker who wins the technical appears to be more likely to become star baker. \n\nA couple of caveats:\n\n- In the early weeks it seems more spread out. I haven't done any stats for this, it's just vibes.\n- In weeks 5, 7, 9, and 10, there was at least one person who came in last in the technical but got star baker. \n    - Yes, that includes the finale - there's a baker who got last in the technical but won the whole show!\n    - Note: there are a couple of seasons which had more bakers than expect, for example week 7 usually has 6 bakers left, but there's a lone observation for a season that had 7 bakers that week. I didn't consider this for this conclusion.\n- In weeks 3 and 10, the person who got second in the technical is the most likely to have been star baker.\n\nIn conclusion, doing well in the technical does tend to be associated with becoming star baker, but this relationship is far from perfect.\n\nIf I had to guess, it looks like the technical probably isn't weighted as highly as the other two challenges.\n",
