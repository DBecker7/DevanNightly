The following plot is a little different from the one before: It’s just the raw counts, rather than percentages.\n\nggplot(bo) +\n    aes(x = Technical.Rank, fill = factor(Star.Baker == 1)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"stack\", colour = 1) +\n    facet_wrap(~ Week.Number) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Rank in the Technical Challenge\",\n        y = \"Count\",\n        fill = \"Star Baker?\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can see that star bakers tend to have won the technical. In other words, the baker who wins the technical appears to be more likely to become star baker.\nA couple of caveats:\n\nIn the early weeks it seems more spread out. I haven’t done any stats for this, it’s just vibes.\nIn weeks 5, 7, 9, and 10, there was at least one person who came in last in the technical but got star baker.\n\nYes, that includes the finale - there’s a baker who got last in the technical but won the whole show!\nNote: there are a couple of seasons which had more bakers than expect, for example week 7 usually has 6 bakers left, but there’s a lone observation for a season that had 7 bakers that week. I didn’t consider this for this conclusion.\n\nIn weeks 3 and 10, the person who got second in the technical is the most likely to have been star baker.\n\nIn conclusion, doing well in the technical does tend to be associated with becoming star baker, but this relationship is far from perfect.\nIf I had to guess, it looks like the technical probably isn’t weighted as highly as the other two challenges."

My hope is that this blog will keep me producing things, rather than leaving things in half-finished states because they’re not quite perfect.\nI plan to post guides on all of the features of a given method (as implemented in R or Python), literature review updates on papers that I think are important for my own work, interesting little mathematical oddities, and brief applications of methods to data that I think are fun."
