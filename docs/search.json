In other words, the baker who wins the technical appears to be more likely to become star baker.\nA couple of caveats:\n\nIn the early weeks it seems more spread out. I haven’t done any stats for this, it’s just vibes.\nIn weeks 5, 7, 9, and 10, there was at least one person who came in last in the technical but got star baker.\n\nYes, that includes the finale - there’s a baker who got last in the technical but won the whole show!\nNote: there are a couple of seasons which had more bakers than expect, for example week 7 usually has 6 bakers left, but there’s a lone observation for a season that had 7 bakers that week. I didn’t consider this for this conclusion.\n\nIn weeks 3 and 10, the person who got second in the technical is the most likely to have been star baker.\n\nIn conclusion, doing well in the technical does tend to be associated with becoming star baker, but this relationship is far from perfect.\nIf I had to guess, it looks like the technical probably isn’t weighted as highly as the other two challenges."

My hope is that this will bring in some new perspectives to sports analytics: restrictions breed creativity.\nI would be ecstatic if anyone stole this idea, but it’s even better if you reach out and we can collaborate on something! For the most part I’m not expecting publications unless one of the analyses gets very involved.\n\nProject Ideas\nAll my ideas are currently based on NHL and PWHL, so please feel free to suggest other teams/analyses!\n\nTampa Bay Lightning Strikes: Lightning strikes tend to happen in clusters in space and time. Is this also true for shots by the Tampa Bay Lightning?\n\nPoint process methods, especially Cox processes, specifically looking for clustering.\nAternatively, do a clustering of all shot locations, then see if there’s some form of self-excitation.\n\nOttawa Senators’ Speeches: The Hansard is a transcript of parliamentary debates, and there are many analyses of this database that look at trends in the words used over time. Can we analyse post-game summaries of the Ottawa Senators with the same methods?\n\nPerform a word embedding based on post-game summaries, then do a basic dimension reduction.\nAlternatively, use a simple TF-IDF and plot it temporally.\nA full analysis might be a dynamic topic modelling approach.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins’ Habitat Utilization: Much research has been done on where penguins like to sleep, eat, and hunt, but where do the Pittsburgh Penguins eat, sleep, and hunt?\n\nGreat opportunity for a marked point process, especially one where the previous events are taken into account.\nAlternatively, partition the ice and consider a temporal ICAR model.\n\nFirst Minnesota Frost: For gardeners, it’s important when the first frost of the year is going to be. For the Minnesota Frost, when will the first shot (or goal) be?\n\nThe time-to-first frost has been analysed several ways, including survival analysis.\nAlternatively: time-to-nth-frost (shot) as a vector regression or multi-step survival analysis.\n\nCalgary Forest Flames: There’s so much analysis of forest fires, there’s bound to be something useful here!"
