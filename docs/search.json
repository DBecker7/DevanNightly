Note that the libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code bears the zlib License, but in the context of the overall libjpeg API library, the terms of the zlib License are subsumed by the terms of the IJG License.\nThe Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below\nThis license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as well as the build system. Note that the TurboJPEG API library wraps the libjpeg API library, so in the context of the overall TurboJPEG API library, both the terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License apply.\n\n\n\nComplying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses\nThis section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding. This is not a license in and of itself. It is intended solely for clarification.\n\nIf you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then:\n\nYou cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the source.\nOrigin\n\nClause 1 of the IJG License\nClause 1 of the Modified BSD License\nClauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License\n\nYou must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file. (If there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)\nOrigin\n\nClause 1 of the IJG License\nClause 2 of the zlib License\n\nYou must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.\nOrigin\n\nClause 1 of the IJG License\n\n\nIf you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:\n\nYour product documentation must include a message stating:\nThis software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.\nOrigin\n\nClause 2 of the IJG license\n\nIf your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD License (see below.)\nOrigin\n\nClause 2 of the Modified BSD License\n\n\nYou cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.\nOrigin\n\nIJG License\nClause 3 of the Modified BSD License\n\nThe IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.\nOrigin\n\nIJG License\nModified BSD License\nzlib License\n\n\n\n\nThe Modified (3-clause) BSD License\nCopyright (C)2009-2024 D.

However, the IJG License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities. Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software."

In other words, the baker who wins the technical appears to be more likely to become star baker.\nA couple of caveats:\n\nIn the early weeks it seems more spread out. I haven’t done any stats for this, it’s just vibes.\nIn weeks 5, 7, 9, and 10, there was at least one person who came in last in the technical but got star baker.\n\nYes, that includes the finale - there’s a baker who got last in the technical but won the whole show!\nNote: there are a couple of seasons which had more bakers than expect, for example week 7 usually has 6 bakers left, but there’s a lone observation for a season that had 7 bakers that week. I didn’t consider this for this conclusion.\n\nIn weeks 3 and 10, the person who got second in the technical is the most likely to have been star baker.\n\nIn conclusion, doing well in the technical does tend to be associated with becoming star baker, but this relationship is far from perfect.\nIf I had to guess, it looks like the technical probably isn’t weighted as highly as the other two challenges."

    "text": "Overview\nThe authors taught a Master’s level course on data science methods at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne). In lieu of a standard project in which students are free to choose their own projects, there was a set of papers to choose from. The students were expected to reproduce two figures from the article they chose: one that the instructors deemed “basic”, and one that the instructors deemed “advanced”. During this process, students answered surveys about their expectations and the realities of their experiences. The students also produced a “creative extension” of the results in the article, in which they were free to analyse the data in a new way."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nOne of the interesting results is that the students didn’t actually know what a data analysis entailed. Keeping in mind that these are Master’s students, it is surprising that the students over-estimated the time commitment of data cleaning and under-estimated the time commitment of the actual analysis stage. In my class, I often warn students how long the cleaning takes - maybe I should slow down on that!\nIn my opinion, the most important result of the study was that providing a framework in which to do a project with an example that is pertinent to that project allowed the students to better understand the material1. Letting students go free with whatever data they want can lead to rabbit holes that distract from the actual material.\nIn the case of this article, the framework they used was replication studies. Instead of giving strict instruction on how to do an analysis, the instructors gave them the goal and let the students find the path. This seems like a great way to structure a project (but it’s not the only way - the end goal doesn’t have to come from published research). Splitting it into a basic and advanced taks helps with stucturing the course since the students can get started without needing to get into complicated methods right away.\nAnother really interesting result is that students used more advanced methods in their “creative extension”. This makes sense: the students are stuck in the muck, so they can go even further. The context is laid out for them, they’ve worked with something that someone else thinks is important, and so their minds are primed to keep going. It’s like following someone else’s well-trodden trail, then encouraging them to blaze a little further; the students know which way to go and have the momentum to keep going.\nThe authors state that they had two half TA workloads devoted to helping with and grading these projects. For a 300+ person class, this seems like a reasonable workload."

    "text": "Alternatives\nThe authors state several times that the replications performed in their class have value for the scientific community, but no evidence is provided for this. I don’t doubt that there can be value here, but knowledge isn’t valuable until it’s shared. The replications performed in the classroom are not being shared outside the classroom as far as I can tell. That being said, highlighting failures in replicating a basic figure due to incomplete descriptions is something I will think about when submitting my next paper!\nAs I noted above, I love the way that a replication study provides structure for a project. It’s not the only way, but it’s a very elegant way. An alternative way to get this value is to simply let the students reproduce a plot/model made by the instructors (rather than a published article). This gives instructors full control over the context and the level of difficulty, while providing the students a clear goal. The data could also be curated to allow for more creative extensions by including more data or by intentionally only studying a subset of the data in the original analysis.\nThis article also reminded me of some replication exercise I saw a while ago. After getting to page 3 of Google search results, I finally found what I was looking for (along with three other similar papers):\n\n\n\nThis study gave a bunch of groups the same data and hypothesis, then asked them to produce a confidence interval. The resultant estimate of each analysis is shown in the image to the right. This demonstrates just how important the “Researcher Degrees of Freedom” or “Garden of Forking Paths” is when doing an analysis.\nSomething similar was done in this study, this study, and this study."

I need to incorporate pre- and post-surveys for more of my assignments and tests to see what my students expect, and where my students are wasting efforts.\nChunkable projects! The replication had several chunks, all of which can be graded separately. This saves the students from having a major project that goes wrong without them knowing, and helps students keep on track.\n\nThis also allows students to build a tangible portfolio, with each “chunk” being an opportunity to demonstrate mastery and show it. This is something I want to incoporporate, so I’ll keep this sort of project in mind.\n\nClear end goals! I might even check out the papers they used, but having a goal to produce a specific thing sounds reasonable. This is also amenable to automatic grading for code assignments.\nCreative extensions!

Most of them are self-explanatory, but I’ll go into some detail for my own sake.\n\nA primer set is what is used to grab the sequences in the wastewater. The the ARTIC protocol, these are about 400 base pair portions of the genome, where the ends of the primers grab the sequence and then the middles are read by the sequencer.\n\nThe ARTIC protocol has several primer schemes. The --primer_set cli argument to swampy allows the user to decide on the primer set, with options defined in the swapy wiki.\nThe primer set probably won’t affect the results too much as long as the correct primer set is provided when processing the simulated reads.\n\nThe --n_reads parameter works as it should, but it’s not necessarily intuitive.\n\nOne person can poop hundreds or thousands of whole or partial genomes.\nThese genomes degrade in the wastewater, so not all portions can be read.\nEach of those genomes could have up to 196 reads1 in the ARTIC protocol.\nSome primers will fail

Based on digging through the code, it works as follows:\n\nChoose the number of each supplied sequence to use (multinomial).\n\nGiven the total reads (--n_reads) and the abundances, it generates the number of each supplied genome according to a multinomial distribution.\n\nChoose the probability of each amplicon (dirichlet * psuedocounts).\n\nThe probability of choosing each amplicon is defined by a Dirichlet distribution. This uses a set of hyperparameters to define the \\(\\underline\\alpha\\) parameter, then samples a new set of probabilities.\nDepending on the primer set, different hyperparameters are assumed. For built-in primer sets, there are files defining these hyperparameters.\nThe pseudocount essentially controls the variance of the dirichlet distribution. A higher pseudocount makes the simulated probabilities closer to the hyperparameters.\n\nSample the amplicons from each genome sequence (multinomial for each genome, based on output of dirichlet)\n\nThe code essentially goes through a for loop (dictionary comprehension), and for each supplied genome it samples amplicons.\n\n\nThe model labelled DIRICHLET_2 appears to be the same as DIRICHLET_1 but does not use pseudocounts. The EXACT model just uses the abundances provided.\nThis process would result in a collection of amplicons that all look exactly the same. This is not realistic - high-throughput sequence tends to produce many errors, but makes up for it by getting a lot of reads.\nTo get these errors, there are several parameters that define genome-wide error rates for insertions, deletions, and substitutions, as well as dirichlet hyper-parameters to ensure that the probabilies provided also have some variance. Alternative alleles are generated for each amplicon, then the number of each alternative allele is chosen based on a multinomial distribution (which, in this case, is a binomial since there’s only the mutation and the original).

    "text": "Conclusion\nA great deal of work has gone into ensureing that short are simulated in a reasonable manner and then correctly placed in a fastq file. I commend the authors on this codebase!\nThe simulation process appears to be reasonable, but choice of the relevant parameters might be tricky. Choice of the parameters will greatly affect the variance of the output, which is the main goal of my research. I plan to use the default values for now, but I will be careful to speak in relative terms. I’m certainly not getting the absolute variance of the estimators - there will always be aleatoric uncertainty, despite our best efforts. However, if I simulate a lot of data sets and get an estimator that tends to have a lower variance, I can be confident that it is lower (but I can’t say that the estimated value is the true value)."

    "text": "An idea I’ve had going for a while. Seems like as good a time as any to make it happen.\nThe general idea: Sports teams are named after things, and those things get studied academically. In this series, I want to take the namesake of a sports team and try to apply the methods used for it’s namesake. My hope is that this will bring in some new perspectives to sports analytics.\nIn addition, it would be fun to reverse the process and apply some sports analytics techniques to the namesake! Can we calculate something like WAR or draft prediction to penguins?\nI would be ecstatic if anyone stole this idea, but it’s even better if you reach out and we can collaborate on something! For the most part I’m not expecting publications unless one of the analyses gets very involved.\n\nProject Ideas\nAll my ideas are currently based on NHL and PWHL, so please feel free to suggest other teams/analyses!\n\nTampa Bay Lightning Strikes: Lightning strikes tend to happen in clusters in space and time. Is this also true for shots by the Tampa Bay Lightning?\n\nPoint process methods, especially Cox processes, specifically looking for clustering.\nAternatively, do a clustering of all shot locations, then see if there’s some form of self-excitation.\nPotential data source: Blitzortung.org (only for contributors).\n\nOttawa Senators’ Speeches: The Hansard is a transcript of parliamentary debates, and there are many analyses of this database that look at trends in the words used over time. Can we analyse post-game summaries of the Ottawa Senators with the same methods?\n\nPerform a word embedding based on post-game summaries, then do a basic dimension reduction.\nAlternatively, use a simple TF-IDF and plot it temporally.\nA full analysis might be a dynamic topic modelling approach.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins’ Habitat Utilization: Much research has been done on where penguins like to sleep, eat, and hunt, but where do the Pittsburgh Penguins eat, sleep, and hunt?\n\nGreat opportunity for a marked point process, especially one where the previous events are taken into account.\nAlternatively, partition the ice and consider a temporal ICAR model.\nPotential data source: seabirdtracking.org\n\nFirst Minnesota Frost: For gardeners, it’s important when the first frost of the year is going to be. For the Minnesota Frost, when will the first shot (or goal) be?\n\nThe time-to-first frost has been analysed several ways, including survival analysis.\nAlternatively: time-to-nth-frost (shot) as a vector regression or multi-step survival analysis.\n\nCalgary Forest Flames: There’s so much analysis of forest fires, there’s bound to be something useful here!"
