This is the first post in my Quarto blog. Welcome!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

In this blog, I'm hoping to keep myself both on track and off track. Brief summaries of papers that I've read will keep my on track, while analyses of toy data will keep me off track (but allow me to expand my skills and my knowledge of various methods). My hope is that this blog will keep me producing things, rather than leaving things in half-finished states because they're not quite perfect.

I plan to post guides on all of the features of a given method (as implemented in R or Python), literature review updates on papers that I think are important for my own work, interesting little mathematical oddities, and brief applications of methods to data that I think are fun.
